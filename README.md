# Assessment PHP Developer

These are a couple of assignments to help determine at what level you work. There are no wrong answers. 
If for example you lack experience in something, that’s only good to know. You shouldn’t spend more than 2 hours on this.

Please clone the project and don't fork it, or you'll make it easy for your competition to copy your work. ;)

Good luck!
